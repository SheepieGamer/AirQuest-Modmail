Hello BlueJayJet! If the person reading this is not BlueJayJet, than leave this repository.
Anyways, when you host this bot make sure to type: pip install -r requirements.txt
Finally, you must create a file called ".env". Put this file under the "settings" folder. Within the .env file, type what I DMed you. The DM will include "This will make sense if you read README.md" and then the stuff to put in .env.
Have fun! Good luck. If you need help hosting it (or u want me to) DM me.
